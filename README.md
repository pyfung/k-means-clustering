# "The squirrel"

Even though the "main course" here is Question 2, it was Question 1 that produced an all-time classic.

[This is a screencap](squirrel.jpg) of part of a student's submission.

Yes, you see that correctly: it included the name and photo of the author of [this webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-to-use-greedy-algorithms/) (I can assure you the student's name was not Jose J. Rodriguez), and ad line about some "3000 hours free course", and, really, a picture of a squirrel. As you can see, the assignment has nothing to do with squirrels. It's also not asking for some generic explanations of why greedy algorithms are bad (which is what Jose's webpage is about).

Initially my thoughts were "how can someone be so stupid to copy all these things". It was only about a year later when I discovered what really happened: it turned out that the assignment was posted on chegg (this wasn't the surprising part), and then someone "answered" the question by copying everything in Jose Rodriguez's webpage; then our student, without using any brain cells that he/she may or may not have, submitted it directly as his/her answer. So there are TWO dumb people here, first the one posting it as an answer on chegg and then our student.

For the record, [here](chegg2a-squirrel.pdf) is a saved copy of the answer on chegg. (Don't get me started about chegg's "copyright". It stole both my question and Mr. Rodriguez's webpage.)

And in subsequent years, there are STILL students submitting this ridiculous answer (to some entirely different questions).
